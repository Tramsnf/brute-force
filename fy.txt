CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the three pillars of cybersecurity. Think of a bank protecting its customer's data: Confidentiality ensures no unauthorized person can access the data; Integrity means the data remains accurate and unaltered; Availability ensures the bank's systems are always up and running for customers to access their accounts.

Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk: A vulnerability is like a weak lock on a door; a threat is a burglar who might exploit the weakness; and risk is the potential loss or harm that occurs if the burglar breaks in.

Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption: Symmetric encryption is like a lockbox with one key that both the sender and receiver have. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one to lock (public key) and one to unlock (private key). Examples: Symmetric - AES; Asymmetric - RSA.

Firewall: A firewall is like a security guard at the entrance of a building, only allowing authorized traffic (people) to enter or leave.

Social Engineering: It's like a con artist tricking you into revealing your password by pretending to be from your bank's customer support.

Common Cyber Attacks: Phishing is like a fake letter from your bank asking for your account details. Organizations can protect themselves by training employees to recognize such scams.

DDoS Attack: Imagine a group of people crowding a store's entrance, preventing real customers from entering. DDoS mitigation involves filtering out fake traffic or dispersing it across multiple servers.

Penetration Test: It's like hiring a locksmith to test the security of your home, finding weaknesses, and recommending improvements.

Network Segmentation: It's like having separate rooms in a building with different access levels, limiting the spread of damage if a breach occurs.

Security Policies and Procedures: These are the rules and guidelines that ensure everyone in an organization follows the same security practices, like locking doors and setting strong passwords.

Defense-in-Depth: It's like having multiple layers of security for your home, such as a fence, locked doors, and a security alarm.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): It's like needing both a key and a fingerprint scan to open a door, making it harder for intruders to gain access.

IDS and IPS: An IDS is like a security camera that alerts you when someone breaks into your home, while an IPS is like a security guard who intervenes and stops the intruder.

White Hat, Black Hat, Grey Hat Hackers: White hats are ethical hackers who help improve security; black hats are criminals who exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain; grey hats are somewhere in between, often breaking rules but without malicious intent.

Responding to a Security Incident: It's like responding to a break-in at your home: contain the damage, investigate what happened, fix the vulnerability, and learn from the experience to prevent future incidents.
